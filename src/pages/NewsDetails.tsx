            <p>
              I thank you for the honour of addressing you on the prospects and
              challenges of building a career in the legal profession. I have no
              doubt whatsoever that you gave much thought to this matter before
              embarking on the study of law. It is often the case that we do not
              know beforehand what the study and practice of law entails before
              we embark on it. In my case it was the headmaster of my primary
              school who, in 1959, advised me to become a lawyer. Then I was
              only thirteen years old. I had never met a lawyer. The headmaster
              himself was not a lawyer. I had never been to a court of law. I
              had never even seen or read book.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              I never forgot the advise of the headmaster and so when in 1968 I
              was seeking admission into university I chose to study law.
              Fortunately I was admitted into the faculty of law of the
              university of Lagos from where I graduated in 1971 and was called
              to the bar in 1972.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then I have done nothing other than law. I have been in it
              for forty-eight years now. They have been forty-eight hard years.
              That is how it is meant to be. Whatever comes to you easily is not
              yours. It is by thy sweat that ye shall live. As lawyers we are
              called to the house of mourning. As the Bible says it is better to
              go to the house of mourning than the house of feasting. And when
              you are there – when you are in the house of mourning – you are
              not to turn it into a house of feasting. That is what we have been
              accused of doing. We have come under suspicion of turning the
              house of sorrow, the house of anxiety, the house of misery into a
              house of feasting – not for those who called us to share in their
              sorrows and anxieties – but for ourselves. Arising from that, my
              first advise to you is this: keep your eyes open for the help that
              you can render. Do not go around with the mentality that you need
              assistance. With that kind of mentality you can never amount to
              much. Go about with the mentality that there is something that you
              can do for others. When you are of that mentality the Lord will
              always equip you to serve. When the Lord looks into your heart and
              sees that you have a disposition to give he will see to it that
              that disposition is fulfilled.
            </p>

              Many of us live in despair. And that is a sin against hope. We
              believe that we cannot make it without a patron. We spend all our
              lives searching for a patron. More often than not we never find
              that patron until we perish in the search. But we do have a patron
              – the Almighty God himself who has ordained that when we seek we
              shall find; when we ask we shall receive; and when we knock he
              shall open unto us. He gave us dominion. Dominion over all things
              and over the entire earth. It is for us to exercise that dominion.
              We come under punishment when we refuse to exercise our dominion
              and prefer instead to live off the sweat and blood of others. It
              is not enough to exert yourself half-heartedly or indifferently.
              That will not do. Because thou hast neither been hot nor cold I
              will spew thee out of my mouth. As a lawyer you have to be
              passionate. If you are not succeeding it simply means that you are
              not striving enough.

              That brings me to the second class. Those of us who presume. We
              suffer, not from despair, but from presumption. We assume that all
              will be well just because we are lawyers. Just as there are many
              who presume that all will be well because they belong to one
              political party or another or just because the minister or the
              governor is a relation of theirs. That is yet another sin -
              against hope – presumption. As a lawyer you are not just going to
              succeed unless you read your books. And there are many things to
              be read. That is why you are called learned. As a lawyer your bend
              as an extension of your office. You lie there to sleep and to
              think. That is the attitude that the Lord rewards. And then the
              lawyer has to be prayerful. You are going nowhere without prayer.
              Unless the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it.
              Our lord jesus Christ enjoined us to pray without ceasing. You can
              take it from me that that injunction applies to lawyers more than
              to any other class of people. In this profession we have often to
              contend with the devil himself. How are you going to succeed
              unless you bring God in? pray for moral strength. Pray for mental
              and intellectual strength. Pray for spiritual strength. We pray
              that at a time when we live in fear we may find courage to
              confront the dangers that menace us on every side. We pray that in
              this age of corruption we may be honest. At a time when we seem
              determined to cast God out of our lives we pray that He may be the
              beginning and the end of our lives.

          <div className="news__intro-3">
            <p>
              We pray that as we look up to God for sympathy so we may look with
              sympathy on those who have entrust us with their lives. Let their
              faith in us be not disappointed as our faith in God is not
              disappointed. As God is faithful so let lawyers also be faithful.
              At a time of greed and selfishness may God grant us the knowledge
              that it is better to give than to receive, better to minister than
              to be ministered to, better to serve than to be served.

              You called me in the hope that I have something to say to you that
              will give you hope. In doing so you gave me hope yourselves. I
              have come, not because I have something new to tell you that you
              do not know already, but to express my gratitude for the hope that
              you give me yourselves. If I have any qualifications to address
              you they derive from the fact that I, myself, am a man who plunged
              into my future without any plans whatsoever. All my life I have
              been groping. And if there is anything remarkable about that, it
              is the fact that throughout, even in the deepest darkness, God has
              been present. Caught in that long midnight, I have come to
              appreciate the mercy and compassion of God. As a nation caught in
              this midnight, we must be consoled by the hope held out by that
              great African, Edward Blyden when he said; “God intends out of all
              this darkness to bring a great light, to rectify all these crooked
              things to the greater glory of His name and to the humbling of the
              pride and wisdom of man.

            Never before has the future seemed so unpredictable. Some say it is
            our economics which have failed. Some blame it on our politics. Yet
            others say it is the social system. There are those who blame it on
            the legal system. It is none of these. It is we who have failed. It
            is man that has failed. No economic theories, no political theories,
            no legal theories are going to save the nation until we purge our
            hearts and souls and return to God. Only by seeking first the
            kingdom of God and its righteousness shall all these other things be
            added unto us. Our Lord Jesus Christ was right when he said that
            bread alone would not suffice. At the time that he said so, the
            political, economic and social conditions of the world were very
            much the same as they are now. The 21st century is no different from
            the 1st century. Labour was exploited at that time just as it is
            exploited today. Israel was under a dictatorship just as we were
            under military rule and just as we are even now because the
            presidential system is actually a dictatorship under the
            constitution. Religion was on the decline at that time just as it is
            now. At that time wealth was in the hands of a few just as it is
            now. If bread alone did not suffice in the time of Christ, bread
            alone will not suffice now.
